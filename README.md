## Face_Detection
> face Detection is a OpenCV task which detects the face using HaarCascade Method. 
## Facial_Recognition
> Face Recognition is performed using **face_recognition** module ,which is pretrained neural network qhich works on algorithm called Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG).
> It Detetcts the ***68 Facial landmarks*** and trained with cnn model to get  ***128 face encodings***.
> Evaluate Face with other faces available by plotting the face encodings on graph and performs Classification using SVM Classifier.
## Number_Plate_Detection
> Number Plate Detection is performed with the help of OCR for Text Extraction and HaarCascade XML file of Number Plate Detection.
## Document_Scanner
> Documment_Scanner will Crop the Page or Document and show in good way.
> It is done by extracting the contour having biggest area among other contours and reshape the image by wrapping and reodering the image properties.
## Shape_Estimator
> Shape Estimator Estimates the shape of the object by estimating the area of obtained from contours detected and predict the shape of the object
## Color_Detection
> Colour Detection is task performed using the trackbars and converting the image into HSV.
> It is used to extract the Hue,Saturation and Value of a color done by adjusting the Track bars.
## Image Classification
> Image Classification is extension of *facial_recognition* task, here we use mutiple number of faces to validate the image and to classify.
##Virtual Paint
> Virtual Paint is a real time task which detects the color and use it a marker to draw images on screen by moving the coloured object on screen.
